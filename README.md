# Ovation framework

(This repository is still under construction. Please let us know if you
find any issues :-) )

The Ovation Framework is a new framework for developing your own Conversational
Intelligence model. This repository was constructed by the
[MindGarage](mindgarage.de) in collaboration with
[Insiders Technologies](http://www.insiders-technologies.de/).


The Framework contains several utility classes to help you to easily build
new Conversational Intelligence architectures. The idea is to give you a head
start in your NLP/Deep Learning project, removing from you the
burden of
thinking about how to get the data, or how to develop a simple Deep
Learning model. You can start from the examples here and build your
own model based on them.

This repository was constructed with a set of NLP/Deep Learning tasks in
mind. The datasets and models that we chose to initially support reflect
this 


# What you'll find here?

This repository was created with the following _pipeline_ in mind:

 * **datasets**: To build any Deep Learning model, you need data. Datasets
	that can be found in the internet come in any format, and it may take
	hours for one to reorganize them into the format that is convenient
	for you. In the `datasets` folder, you'll find a set of utility classes
	that simply load the data for you and allow it to be accessed in
	several ways that we deemed useful for performing the Deep Learning
	tasks we had in mind.
 * **models**: Now that we have access to the data, we need to write models
	that receive the data (in a suitable format) and output some result.
	In the `models` folder you'll find some example model classes for
	performing the 

 * **tests**: To test

# How to use this Repository?

The repository is composed 


## Simple example



This repository contains utility classes to load data from several
datasets in a customizable format. Additionally, it contains some
code templates that one may use as a starting point to write their
own Deep Learning models.
The code templates are provided mainly in tensorflow + tflearn.
